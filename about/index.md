I'm a [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) master student, with my interest focus on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I majored in [Master of Machine Learning and Computer Vision](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2019/program/MMLCV).

Previously, I completed my B.Eng degree in Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai Campus in 2018, under the supervision of [Bo Lang](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/71104301_Bo_Lang).
